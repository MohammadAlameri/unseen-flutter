# Website Design Plan: The Unseen Flutter

## 1. Overall Aesthetic & Mood

**Goal:** To create a modern, clean, and interactive website that is visually appealing and easy to navigate, catering to both English and Arabic users.

**Inspiration:** Drawing from current web design trends (2025) focusing on: 
- **Clean and Minimalist Layouts:** Emphasizing content with ample whitespace.
- **Subtle Animations & Micro-interactions:** Enhancing user experience without being distracting.
- **Vibrant but Harmonious Color Palettes:** Using gradients and complementary colors.
- **Clear Typography:** Ensuring readability across languages.
- **Card-based UI:** For intuitive content organization and visual appeal.

**Mood:** Professional, engaging, informative, and modern.

## 2. Color Palette

Leverage a gradient-based primary color for accents and interactive elements, combined with a neutral palette for background and text to ensure readability and a clean look.

- **Primary Accent:** Blue-Cyan Gradient (e.g., `#3B82F6` to `#06B6D4`)
- **Neutrals (Light Mode):**
    - Background: `#FFFFFF` (White) to `#F8FAFC` (Light Grayish Blue)
    - Text: `#1F2937` (Dark Gray)
    - Borders/Dividers: `#E5E7EB` (Light Gray)
- **Neutrals (Dark Mode):**
    - Background: `#111827` (Dark Blue-Gray) to `#1F2937` (Dark Gray)
    - Text: `#F9FAFB` (Off-White)
    - Borders/Dividers: `#374151` (Medium Dark Gray)

## 3. Typography

Prioritize readability and a modern feel. Use a sans-serif font family.

- **English:** `Inter` (for headings and body text)
- **Arabic:** `Noto Sans Arabic` (for headings and body text, ensuring proper rendering and legibility for RTL)
- **Font Sizes:** Hierarchical and responsive for different screen sizes.
    - H1: 3rem - 4.5rem (responsive)
    - H2: 2rem - 3rem (responsive)
    - Body: 1rem - 1.125rem

## 4. Layout & Structure

**Overall:** Clean, responsive, and intuitive. Max-width containers for content to improve readability on large screens.

- **Header:**
    - Sticky, transparent/blurred background on scroll.
    - Logo (text-based with an icon) on the left (LTR) / right (RTL).
    - Navigation links for Parts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3).
    - Right-aligned (LTR) / Left-aligned (RTL) utility icons: Language Toggle, Theme Toggle, Search.
